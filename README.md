# NaiveSet
Data structure: SET

Implement class for extensible bit set.

In first line of input.txt there are integer numbers that should be inserted into the set ( 0 ≤ N ≤ 100000 ). 
Second line provides numbers for test. If number is the set you write true to the output.txt file, false otherwise. 
Separate them by spaces.
